While we are bound by customs, norms, and relationships in real life, our imagination provides an escape where we can live according to our own desires, free from restrictions. This mental freedom can bring happiness, healing, and therapeutic benefits by allowing us to envision and experience scenarios that are impossible in real life. However, the unrestrained flow of imagination can sometimes lead to frustration if not guided positively. Overall, positive imaginative thinking offers a means to achieve real pleasure and mental well-being.','Imagination is very powerful . It&#039;s related to different level of imagination of different people because every individual think differently. We all born free but we are living in chains . We are not free but chained with customs , people , norms, believes, rules and regulations , relationships etc. But we all have only one thing that make us to live freely on our own choice , that is our thinking, imagination. Imagination makes us to think freely we can do what we really want without thinking about restrictions. In imagination we can create a free different imaginative world to live according to our own choices. It will make us to live happily freely in peaceful environment. The power of imagination will give us opportunity to imagine things that could never be happened in real life. We can imagine snowy mountain , green gardens , high hills, Oceans, clouds, rain, nearest people even more paradise , in which you are living with your ideal people, ideal environment , ideal life style that requires no money, no permissions, no norms, no believes , no rules and regulations .  That could be possible in only imagination not in reality. It is the power of imagination to create ideal situation. You just need to close your eyes and start thinking , imagine the things, the people that you like the most. It has power to heal your hidden wounds. It works as therapy for your physical and mental health. It has power to speak up about those things that you can&#039;t speak in reality, you can wear dresses, eat foods , sing songs, make fun, talk about sad/happy movements, live with someone that you want really and many more, it will give you life long real pleasure. But sometimes this imagination will make you frustrated. All times this stream of consciousness can create an thunderstorm in your mind that can be harmful too.

(2,1,'Difference between phonology and phonetics. ','In essence, the distinction between phonetics and phonology lies in their approach to the study of speech sounds. Phonetics focuses on the physical properties and articulation of speech sounds, while phonology delves into how these sounds are used within specific languages to convey meaning. This distinction is exemplified by Kenneth Pike&#039;s famous quotation, &quot;Phonetics gathers the raw material; phonology cooks it.&quot;\r\nAt the segmental level, phonetics analyzes the physical production of speech sounds, whereas phonology examines how these sounds function within the linguistic system of a particular language. For instance, while phonetics may describe the articulation of a sound like the voiceless dental fricative, phonology would investigate its role and distribution within languages such as English or German.\r\nFurthermore, phonetics encompasses suprasegmental aspects like pitch and stress patterns, while phonology investigates their linguistic functions, such as lexical distinctions or morphological roles. Ultimately, phonetics provides the foundational material for phonology to explore the intricate patterns and rules governing sound systems in languages.','central concepts of phonology and phonetics discuss the main differences between phonetics and phonology. The relationship between these two branches of linguistics can be adequately described and illustrated by a famous quotation phonetics gathers the raw material phonemic s&#039; cooks it what does this quotation by the famous Kenneth Pike mean well in a nutshell whereas phonetics studies speech in general and provides the general material that is speech sounds and suprasegmentals information phonology we&#039;re here the term phonemic s&#039; which is slightly outdated has been used phonology uses this material in order to discover patterns formulate rules or to investigate the principles governing the sound systems of particular languages phonetic and phonological studies can be subdivided into two levels. level 1 the segmental level or as my teacher David crystal would have said, it this means basically what you say and the suprasegmentals level which can be associated with how you say something. Let us illustrate the difference between phonetics and phonology and start with the segmental level speech sounds are the product of human anatomy and physiology one goal of segmental phonetics is to define the articulatory properties of all human speech sounds. For example a fern a Titian discusses the articulation of a voiceless dental fricative to pick just one example then a phonologists who studies the sound systems of particular languages or the sound inventories of particular languages would ask what is the function of this sound . This voiceless dental fricative in languages such as ebo German or English you all know the answer don&#039;t you a voiceless dental fricative is clearly part of the English sound inventory but it is not used in German and it is not used in ebo in other words. A phonetic study reveals how sounds are made phonology works out how these sounds are used in particular languages in order to convey meaning. Let us elaborate this difference between phonetics and phonology on the basis of German my mother tongue and English part of a phonetic study of German. For example will include a statement that this sound here which is listed here a voiceless palatal fricative or curse in German but not in English so here is an example first of all to show the articulation . I hear again so this exists in German but it is not really found in English. Likewise a phonetic study of both languages will include a statement that these sounds -sir and sir occur both in English and in German so much for the phonetic analysis. However the main phonological question is whether the sounds in question are functional sound units that is units that affect the meaning of words in that language or not a phonetic study then provides an inventory and a description of the occuring segments. Phonology discusses the function of these segments in particular languages in the case of our first example the palatal fricative sure the answer is pretty clear. It exists in both languages in German. It occurs in contexts where a front vowel precedes words such as ich Peck master cooker or at the beginning of words such bas henna or Hemi a phonologists would also say it is in complimentary distribution with the velar fricative ha which only occurs after back vowels as in boo da or da in English , however it is , if it is used at all highly restricted to contexts where a written H precedes. It is the same palatal fricative as in human huge or humid follow logically however it is mostly analyzed as a combination of a glottal fricative plus a palatal approximant since languages may have the same inventory but different realizations of these sound segments a mere segmental. Phonological study that states which segments occur in a language and which ones do not is only superficial consider our second example the status of cell in English and German well we have two options it could be one sound unit or two whereas German lists sir as one segment English does not why well , here is the answer the German example is in this case zealots and in English were using the example salts. The plural form of this word the plural form of salt both German zealots which means salt and English salts involve the same final segment . However a structural analysis reveals that native speakers of English identify two consonants whereas in German this is clearly one consonant .Where in German you have one letter and in English you have to maybe orthography influences their decision. Furthermore and this is more important ,has only a limited distribution in English it normally crosses morpheme boundaries as in what&#039;s which stands for what is States which stands for state plus plural or kit which stands for kit plus plural state by the way could also be a verb state plus third-person singular so in each case we have a morpheme boundary between the base form and the afix sir thus distributional and structural arguments support the different phonological analysis officer in English in German. One unit in German two units in English and what about the Supra segment 11. Well again there are Supra segmental inventories with clearly definable functions the structures and phenomena beyond the segments are among others tonal phenomena where for example in the so called tone languages such as Chinese tonal patterns Express lexical distinctions or have a morphological role expressing such features as tense or aspect and then there are stress phenomena where for example in words of more than one syllable at least one syllable has more prominence and can thus influence the meaning of that word these suprasegmentals aspects are often discussed under the heading of metrical phonology again let us look at these aspects first from a phonetic angle and then from a phonological one supra segmental phonetics investigates aspects such as loudness pitch or lengths take pitch as an example in English pitch is changing continuously . There are no steady-state pitches. Here are some examples which I&#039;m going to discuss in a second as we will see throughout every syllable in a normal conversational utterance the pitch is going up and down as most languages English uses the whole range of pitch variation let&#039;s listen to these examples first mary gave the money to her father by set by the window reading a book he wanted to go to town on Monday well as you see pitch is going up and down however and this is a central question of English suprasegmentals or knowledge II can the meaning of an utterance be determined by the type of pitch variation used has pitch variation a particular function in English well tonal variation exists in English however it is difficult to generalize imagine someone says I saw a pink elephant and your answer is really does your answer really said with a level tone always express boredom or does arise such as really Express excitement surely one can associate specific emotions with certain tones for example boredom with level tones yet there is no rule-based pattern thus apart from a few examples where tonal variation leads to predictable meaning differences the function of tone is restricted in English as far as stress the phonological correlate of loudness and pitch is concerned the situation is more obvious clearly in present-day English the placement of stress can lead to differences in meaning at least in three ways the first type is referred to as lexical stress where the placement of stress can lead to a distinction between nouns and verbs in contrast the first syllable is stressed and we have a noun whereas in contrast we have a verb with the second syllable receiving the stress or take shift stress as an example where words such as 13 can be stressed on the first syllable in cases such as a 13 year old girl whereas the second syllable has to be stressed if you want to say something like she is 13 and last but not least there is weakening where in sentences such as he asked for questions the stress of fall leads to an interpretation that he asked for questions are not 5 whereas in he asked for questions the interpretation where the word 4 is unstressed he asked for question the interpretation is that he wanted some questions to be asked okay so much for the main differences between phonetics and phonology perhaps the best way to remember these differences is the quotation with which I started phonetics gathers the raw material phonology','360.jpg','Postpics/1144359480_360.jpg','Active',1,'2024-05-26 03:00:23',NULL),
(3,1,'The Nature of Language and Linguistics highlighted by authors.','Language is a multifaceted human phenomenon that plays a crucial role in communication, cognition, and cultural exchange. It serves as a symbolic system based on arbitrary conventions, allowing for the expression of ideas, emotions, and desires. While various definitions attempt to capture the essence of language, it remains a complex and dynamic entity. Linguists have described language as a system of voluntary symbols, a means of communication and interaction, and a set of structured sentences constructed from finite elements. Ultimately, language enables human civilization, fosters social cooperation, and shapes the way we perceive and engage with the world.',' Language is God’s special gift to mankind. Without language human civilization, as we now know it, would have remained an impossibility. Language is ubiquitous. It is present everywhere––in our thoughts and dreams, prayers and meditations, relations and communication. Besides being a means of communication, and storehouse of knowledge, it is an instrument of thinking as well as a source of delight (e.g. singing). It transfers knowledge from one person to another and from one generation to another. Language is also the maker or unmaker of human relationships.  It is our ability to communicate through words that makes us different from animals. Because of its omnipresence, language is often taken for granted. Definition of Language Since linguistics is the study of language, it is imperative for linguist to know what language is. Language is a very complex human phenomenon; all attempts to define it have proved inadequate. In a nut-shell, language is an ‘organized noise’ used in actual social situations. That is why it has also been defined as ‘contextualized systematic sound‘. In order to understand a term like life, one has to talk of the properties or characteristics of living beings (e.g. motion, reproduction, respiration, growth, power of self-healing, excretion, nutrition, mortality, etc. etc.). Similarly, the term language can be understood better in terms of its properties or characteristics. Some linguists, however, have been trying to define language in their own ways even though all these definitions have been far from satisfactory. Here are some of these definitions:\r\n\r\n 1. Language is a symbol system based on pure or arbitrary conventions... infinitely extendable and modifiable according to the changing needs and conditions of the speakers. (Robins) According to this definition, language is a symbol system. Every languages selects some symbols for its selected sounds. The English sound /k/ for example has the symbol k for it. These symbols form the alphabet of the language and join in different combinations to form meaningful words. \r\n\r\nThe system talked of here is purely arbitrary in the sense that there is no one to one correspondence between the structure of a word and the thing it stands for. The combination p.e.n., for example stands, in English, for an instrument used for writing. Why could it not be e.p.n. or n.e.p.? Well, it could also be e.p.n. or n.e.p. and there is nothing sacrosanct about the combination p.e.n. except that it has now become a convention—a convention that cannot be easily changed. As stated here, language conventions are not easily changed, yet it is not impossible to do so. Language is infinitely modifiable and extendable. Words go on changing meanings and new words continue to be added to language with the changing needs of the community using it.\r\n\r\n 2. Language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols. (Sapir) There are two terms in this definition that call for discussion: human and non-instinctive. Language, as Sapir rightly said, is human. Only humans possess language and all normal humans uniformly possess it. Animals do have a communication system but it is not a developed system. That is why language is said to be species-specific andspecies-uniform. Also, language does not pass from a parent to a child. In this sense it is non-instinctive. A child has to learn language and he/she learns the language of the society he/she is placed in.\r\n\r\n 3. Language is the institution whereby humans communicate and interact with each other by means of habitually used oral-auditory arbitrary symbols. (Hall) This definition rightly gives more prominence to the fact that language is primarily speech produced by oral-auditory symbols. A speaker produces some string of oral sounds that get conveyed through the air to the speaker who, through his hearing organs, receives the sound waves and conveys these to the brain that interprets these symbols to arrive at a meaning.\r\n\r\n 4.   A language is a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements. (Noam Chomsky) Chomsky meant to convey that each sentence has a structure. Human brain is competent enough to construct different sentences from out of the limited set of sounds/symbols belonging to a particular language. Human brain is so productive that a child can at any time produce a sentence that has never been said or heard earlier. \r\n\r\n5.   A language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols used for human communication.        (Wardaugh) \r\n\r\n6.   A language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates.

(4,1,'Drama, prose novel short story and it&#039;s types. ','Drama encompasses a mode of fictional representation through dialogue and performance, serving as a vital genre within literature. It involves the portrayal of action through dialogue or pantomime, typically intended for theater, television, radio, or film. Comedy and tragedy are prominent types, with comedies aiming to evoke laughter through light-hearted circumstances and witty remarks, while tragedies explore darker themes like disaster and death, often involving protagonists with tragic flaws. Other types include farce, melodrama, and musical drama, each offering unique styles and approaches to storytelling.\r\n\r\nProse, on the other hand, is a form of language characterized by a natural flow of speech and grammatical structure. Novels, as a subset of prose fiction, present lengthy narrative works typically published as single books. They encompass various types such as realistic novels, historical novels, epistolary novels, and bildungsromans, each offering distinct narrative approaches and themes. Novellas, shorter narrative works, also contribute to prose fiction, often focusing on a single plot or theme with fewer characters than a novel. Additionally, short stories, fictional prose works shorter in length than novels, concentrate on one central plot, character, and theme, making them succinct yet impactful narratives.','Drama \r\n\r\nDrama is a mode of fictional representation through dialogue and performance. It is one of the literary genres, which is an imitation of some action. Drama is also a type of a play written for theater, television, radio, and film. In simple words, a drama is a composition in verse or prose presenting a story in pantomime or dialogue. It contains conflict of characters, particularly the ones who perform in front of audience on the stage. The person who writes drama for stage directions is known as a “dramatist” or “playwright.”\r\n\r\n Types of Drama Let us consider a few popular types of drama: \r\n\r\n Comedy \r\n\r\n Comedies are lighter in tone than ordinary works, and provide a happy conclusion. The intention of dramatists in comedies is to make their audience laugh. Hence, they use quaint circumstances, unusual characters, and witty remarks. \r\n\r\nTragedy \r\n\r\nTragic dramas use darker themes, such as disaster, pain, and death. Protagonists often have a tragic flaw — a characteristic that leads them to their downfall. Farce  Generally, a farce is a nonsensical genre of drama, which often overacts or engages slapstick humour. \r\n\r\nMelodrama   \r\n\r\nMelodrama is an exaggerated drama, which is sensational and appeals directly to the senses of the audience. Just like the farce, the characters are of a single dimension and simple, or may be stereotyped. Musical Drama   In musical dramas, dramatists not only tell their stories through acting and dialogue, but through dance as well as music. Often the story may be comedic, though it may also involve serious subjects.\r\n\r\n Prose\r\n\r\n Prose is a form or technique of language that exhibits a natural flow of speech and grammatical structure.  \r\n\r\nNovel \r\n\r\nA Novel is a long narrative work of fiction with some realism. It is often in prose form and is published as a single book. The word ‘novel’ has been derived from the Italian word ‘novella’ which means “new”. Similar to a short story, a novel has some features like a representation of characters, dialogues, setting, plot, climax, conflict, and resolution. However, it does not require all the elements to be a good novel. \r\n\r\nTypes: Realistic Novel:                                 A fictional attempt to give the effect of realism. This sort of novel is sometimes called a novel of manner. A realistic novel can be characterized by its complex characters with mixed  motives that are rooted in social class and operate according to highly developed social structure. The characters in realistic novel interact with other characters and undergo plausible and everyday experiences. Examples: Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, Looking for Alaska by John Green. \r\n\r\nPicaresque Novel: \r\n\r\n  A picaresque novel  relates the adventures of an eccentric or disreputable hero in episodic form. The genre gets its name from the Spanish word picaro, or &quot;rogue.&quot; Examples: Rudyard Kipling&#039;s Kim (1901), Henry Fielding’s The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749), Historical Novel:          A Historical novel is a novel set in a period earlier than that of the writing. Examples: Thackeray&#039;s Vanity Fair, Charles Dickens&#039;s A Tale of Two Cities,  \r\n\r\nEpistolary Novel:                                 Epistolary fiction is a popular genre where the narrative is told via a series of documents. The word epistolary comes from Latin where ‘epistola’ means a letter. Letters are the most common basis for epistolary novels but diary entries are also popular Examples: Samuel Richardson’s Pamela and Clarissa, Bram Stoker’s Dracula,  Bildungsroman:    German terms that indicates a growth. This fictional autobiography concerned with the development of the protagonist’s mind, spirit, and characters from childhood to adulthood. Examples: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann etc. \r\n\r\nGothic Novel: \r\n\r\n Gothic novel includes terror, mystery, horror, thriller, supernatural, doom, death, decay, old haunted buildings with ghosts and so on. Examples: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Bram Stoker’s Dracula,   \r\n\r\n Autobiographical Novel:       \r\n\r\n       An autobiographical novel is a novel based on the life of the author. Examples: Charles Dickens’ David Coppefield, Great Expectations, D. H. Lawrence’s Sons and Lovers, Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar, Ralph Ellison ‘s Invisible Man, Maya Angelou’ s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Virginia Wolfe’s The Light House etc. \r\n\r\nNovella \r\n\r\nA novella is a short, narrative, prose fiction. As a literary genre, the novella’s origin lay in the early Renaissance literary work of the Italians and the French. As the etymology suggests, novellas originally were news of town and country life worth repeating for amusement and edification. Examples: Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, \r\n\r\nStream of Consciousness Novel or Psychological Novel:                                 Psychological novels are works of fiction that treat the internal life of the protagonist (or several or all characters) as much as (if not more than) the external forces that make up the plot. The phrase “Stream of Consciousness” was coined by William James in his Principles of Psychology (1890), to describe the flow of thought of the waking mind. Examples: Virginia Wolfe’s To the Lighthouse, Mrs. Dolloway, James Joyce’s Ulysses, D. H. Lawrence’s Sons and Lovers, The Rainbow. \r\n\r\nSocial Fiction/ Political Novel:                                 The genre focussed on possible development of societies, very often dominated by totalitarian governments. This type of novels must have social and political message. The term generally refers to fiction in Europe and the Soviet Union reacting to Communist rule. Examples: George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Huxley’s Brave New World etc. \r\n\r\nDystopian Novel:                                 A dystopia is an unpleasant (typically repressive) society, often propagandized as being utopian. Examples: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.  \r\n\r\n Short Story:\r\n\r\nA short story is fictional work of prose that is shorter in length than a novel. Edgar Allan Poe, in his essay &quot;The Philosophy of Composition,&quot; said that a short story should be read in one sitting, anywhere from a half hour to two hours. In contemporary fiction, a short story can range from 1,000 to 20,000 words.  Because  of  the  shorter  length,  a  short  story  usually  focuses  on  one  plot,  one  main character  (with  a  few  additional  minor  characters),  and  one  central  theme,  whereas  a novel  can  tackle  multiple  plots  and  themes,  with  a  variety  of  prominent  characters.

(5,1,'Literature , poetry types of poetry subjective and objective poetry','Literature, in its broadest sense, is any written work. Etymologically, the term derives from Latin litaritura/litteratura “writing formed with letters,” although some definitions include spoken or sung texts. More restrictively, it is writing that possesses literary merit.  ','Definition: For the creation of a masterwork of literature two powers must concur, the power of the man and the power of the moment, and the man is not enough without the moment    (ATTHEW ARNOLD, The Functions of Criticism at the present) Literature is as old as speech. It grew out of human need for it, and it has not changed except to become more needed. (JOHN STEINBECK, Nobel Prize acceptance speech) \r\n\r\n Classification Poetry-drama-prose Poetry: \r\n\r\nA poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language.           (W. H. Auden) A poem begins as a lump in the throat, a sense of wrong, a homesickness, a lovesickness.  (Robert Frost) Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity.  (William Wordsworth) Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal.  (T.S. Eliot)  \r\n\r\nI wish our clever young poets would remember my homely definitions of prose and poetry; that is prose; words in their best order; – poetry; the best words in the best order.  (Samuel Taylor Coleridge)  \r\n\r\nTypes of poetry :\r\n\r\n Subjective-Objective \r\n\r\nSubjective Poetry:  It is supplied by the poet’s own thoughts and feelings.  A poet brings it from within, giving expression, that is to say, to the thoughts and feelings it arouses in his mind, his treatment is subjective. Objective Poetry:  In objective poetry subject matter is supplied by external objects, such as deeds, events and the things we see around us. In Objective Poetry the poet acts as a detached observer, describing what he has seen or heard. Subjective Poetry Types The lyric   It is a short poem, characterised by simplicity in language and treatment.   It deals with a single emotion which is generally stated in the first few lines.  It is musical. Verbal-music is an important element in its appeal and charm. Various devices are used by poets to enhance the music of their lyrics. THE ELEGY \r\n\r\nThe elegy is an expression of the emotion of sorrow, woe, or despair. In short, the elegy is a lament, a lyric of mourning, or an utterance of personal bereavement and sorrow and, therefore, it should be characterised by absolute sincerity of emotion and expression. In common use, it is often restricted to a lament over the dead, but that is an improper narrowing of its meaning. There are laments over places, over lost love, over the past (which is never “dead”), over an individual’s misery or failure; there are laments over departed pet animals, and so forth. The Pastoral Elegy The pastoral elegy is a special kind of elegy. The words ‘pastoral’ comes from the Greek word “pastor”, which means “to graze”. Hence pastoral elegy is an elegy in which the poet represents himself as a shepherd mourning the death of a fellow shepherd. The form arose among the ancient Greeks, and Theocritus, Bions and Moschus were its most noted practitioners. In ancient Rome it was used by the Latin poet Virgil. In England, countless pastoral elegies have been written down from the Renaissance (16th century) to the present day. Spenser’s Astrophel, Milton’s Lycidas, Shelley’s Adonais and Arnold’s Thyrsis and Scholar Gipsy, are the most notable examples of pastoral elegy in the English language. \r\n\r\nTHE ODE \r\n\r\nThe Ode is a special kind of lyric, more dignified, stately and elaborate than the simple lyric. Like the lyric, it also originated in ancient Greece. The Greek poet Pindar was the first to write Odes, and later on the form was practiced with certain modification by the Roman poet, Horace. The word ‘ode’ is simply the Greek word for ‘song’. It was used by the Greeks for any kind of lyric verse, i.e. for any song sung with the lyre or to the accompaniment of some dance. However, as far as English literature is concerned, the term is now applied to only one particular kind of lyric verse. An English Ode may be defined as, ‘a lyric poem of elaborate metrical structure, solemn in tone, and usually taking the form of address” very often to some abstraction or quality It is in the form of an address, often to some abstraction. It is not written about but written to. Two Kinds There are two important forms of the ode (1) The Pindaric Ode; and (2) The Horation Ode.  (1)  The Pindaric Ode Pindar the greatest lyric poet of ancient Greece (6th to 5th century B.C.) was the father of the Pindaric or Choric’ Ode. Pindaric Odes were written generally in honour of the gods or to sing the triumphs or victories of rulers or athletes. Hence they are also known as “triumphal” odes. A Pindaric Ode has a fixed stanza-structure or pattern. The number of stanzas may vary, but they are invariably arranged in groups of three, each group being called a triad. The first stanza in each triad is called a ‘strophe’ – it was chanted by the dancing chorus as it proceeded in one direction. The second stanza in each triad is called an ante-strophe’ – it was chanted by the chorus as it returned. The third stanza in each triad is called an ‘epode’, and it was sung when the chorus was stationary. Just as the total number of stanzas in a Pindaric Ode mayvary (Pindar’s odes range from one triad to thirteen in length) so also there could be variations in the metrical length of individual lines. Thus the Pindaric Ode has a fixed stanza-pattern but enjoys great rhythmical and metrical freedom. The Poet Cowley (1618-67) was the first poet of England to imitate consciously the Pindaric odes. However, he did not understand the regular structure of the Pindaric and introduced a verse form with long irregular stanzas without any fixed system of metre or rhyme. The true Pindaric in triadic form was written with success by Dryden (Ode to St. Cecilia and Alexander’s Feast) and then by Gray (The Bard and the Progress of Poesy). After Gray, Pindaric of the triadic form fell out of fashion.\r\n\r\n (2)  The Horatian Ode This kind of Ode has been named after the Latin poet, Horace, who imitated Pindar but with far reaching modifications. The Horation Ode consists of a number of stanzas with a more or less regular metrical structure but without any division into triads of the Pindaric. It may be rhymed or unrhymed. This kind of Ode is light and personal (not choric) without the elaboration and complexity of the Pindaric. Many of the Finest English Odes are of this lighter sort. Some notable examples are: Wind Wordsworth’s Ode to Duty; Shelley’s Ode of the West Wind; and Keats’ Ode to Nightingale. \r\n\r\nTHE SONNET\r\n\r\n The Petrarchan Sonnet The sonnet also is a form of the lyric, and of all its forms it is most carefully ordered and bound by definite, rigid rules. The word “Sonnet” is derived from the Greek word “Sonneto”, meaning, “a sound”. It is a short lyric of fourteen lines and the Italian poet Petrarch was the first to use this form of the lyric to express his love for his beloved Laura, and its use “became the mark of Petrarchan love-poetry all over Europe in the 16th century.” Petrarch had divided his sonnets into two parts, the octave of eight lines and the sestet of six lines, with a pause or ceasura after the eighth line. Its rhyme-scheme was a b, b a, a b , b a,     c d e, c d e. The Sonnet in England – Early Sonnetteers Sir Thomas Wyatt was the first to write sonnets in England. It is the Petrarchan form of the sonnet that Wyatt follows. His use of this measure is often rigid and awkward, and he entirely fails to capture the warm, sensuous colour and delicate music of the Italian poet. His great contemporary Earl of Surrey also wrote sonnets in which he expressed his entirely imaginative love for Geraldine or Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n  Objective Poetry and its different forms \r\n\r\nTHE BALLAD \r\n\r\nThe Ballad may be defined as a short-story in verse. The word Ballad is derived from the word “Ballare” which means “to dance”. Originally a ballad was a song with a strong narrative substance sung to the accompaniment of dancing. The minstrel or the bard would sing the main parts, and the dancers would sing the refrain or certain lines which were frequently repeated. Often it was in the form of a dialogue. Thus the popular ballad had a strong dramatic element. In this way it is possible to divide ballads into two kinds or categories:\r\n\r\n (a) The “Popular ballad” or the Ballad of growth with its simplicity, its apparent ease and artlessness, and its primitive feeling, and (b) the “literary ballad”, the conscious imitation of a later date of the original popular ballad.

(6,1,'LINGUISTICS Definition scope ',' Linguistics is a growing and interesting area of study, having a direct hearing on fields as diverse as education, anthropology, sociology, language teaching, cognitive psychology and philosophy. What is linguistics? Fundamentally, it is concerned with the nature of language and communication.  ','Some of the definitions of linguistics are as under: \r\n\r\n1.                  “Linguistics observes language in action as a means for determining how language has developed, how it functions today, and how it is currently evolving.” (G. Duffy)\r\n\r\n 2.                  “Linguistics is concerned with the nature of human language, how it is learned and what part it plays in the life of the individual and the community.” (S. Pit Corder)\r\n\r\n 3.                  “Linguistics tries to answer two basic questions: a.      What is language? b.      How does language work.” (Jean Aitchison) 4.                  “The scientific study of human language is called linguistics”. (Victoria A. Fromkin) \r\n\r\nLinguistics is the scientific study of language. By this we mean language in general, not a particular language. If we were concerned with studying an individual language, we would say ‘I’m studying French... or English,’ or whichever language we happen to be studying. But linguistics does not study an individual language, it studies ‘language’ in general. That is, linguistics, according to Robins (1985): is concerned with human language as a universal and recognizable part of the human behaviour and of the human faculties, perhaps one of the most essential to human life as we know it, and one of the most far-reaching of human capabilities in relation to the whole span of mankind’s achievements. Does this not sound a little abstract? It is, because there is no way of studying ‘language’ without referring to and taking examples from particular languages. However, even while doing so, the emphasis of linguistics is different. Linguistics does not emphasise practical knowledge or mastery of a particular language. Linguists may know only one language, or may know several, or may even study a language they do not know at all. What they are trying to study are the ways in which language is organised to fulfil human needs, as a system of communication. There is a difference between a person who knows many languages (called a polyglot), and a linguist,who studies general principles of language organisation and language behaviour, often with reference to some actual language or languages. Any language can be taken up to illustrate the principles of language organisation, because all languages reveal something of the nature of language in general. (Of course, it may he of help to a linguist to know more languages so  that  differences  and  contrasts  as  well  as  similarities  between  the  languages  can  also  be studied  in  a  better  way.)  We  can  say  that  linguistics  is  learning  about language  rather  than learning  a  language.  Thi s  distinction  is  often  explained  as  the  difference  between  learning  how  a car  works  and  learning  how  to  drive  a  car.  When  we  learn  how  to  drive  a  car,  we  learn  a  set  of habits  and  do  some  practice — this  is  similar  to  learning  how  to  speak  a  language.  When  w e  learn how the  car  works,  we  open  up  its  mechanism,  study  it  and  investigate  the  relationship  of  its parts  to  one  another.  This  is  similar  to  what  we  do  in  a  scientific  study  of  language,  or linguistics:  we  investigate  the  mechanism  of  language,  its  parts and  how all  these  parts  fit together  to  perform  particular  functions,  and  why  they  are  arranged  or  organised  in  a  certain manner.  Just  as  while  driving  a  car,  we  are  using  its  various  components,  while  speaking  a language  we  are  using  the  sounds,  words,  e tc.  of  that  language;  behind  these  uses  is  the mechanism  which  enables  us  to  do  so.  We  study  language  because  it  is  important  for  us  to understand  this  mechanism.

(11,3,'Freelancing is a way to beat unemployment','Unemployment is one of the most serious social problems in Pakistan. Whenever a problem develops in any society, there is always more than one cause. Certainly, there is more than one cause of unemployment. The main reasons for this are population inflation and lack of sources of employment. While other reasons include bribery and recommendation, lack of seriousness of students, defects in academic standards, focus on obtaining a single certificate instead of preparing students for the future at the university level, focus on single book knowledge instead of applied knowledge, etc. There are significant reasons.','As a result of the rising unemployment rate, students and young graduates often seem anxious and worried about their future and ask various questions about their future. I usually give students two pieces of advice.\r\n\r\n1) Students should read the blog they are reading not just for the sake of reading or just to memorize but to understand the blog and read it in the context of its practical application. In our country, theoretical subjects are considered unnecessary or insignificant and this misunderstanding is found even among the teachers themselves. The theory is actually a summary of the practical experiences and research of others, which tells us what the subject is, how this knowledge originated, what its purpose is, and how this knowledge can be put into practical use and application. Therefore, students should read these blogs in this context and gain an understanding.\r\n\r\n2) Students should learn some skills along with teaching knowledge and then start working for themselves.\r\nIn Pakistan, summer in the plains and hot areas and winter in the cold and mountainous areas usually have two and a half to three months of vacation. Most students usually graduate during this time, so this time can be spent on learning these skills.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to learn these skills. Usually, during these holidays different universities and private institutes offer different types of courses, so these skills can be learned from these resources. Another alternative is that different institutions also offer different courses online, so you can learn from home. If a student does not have the financial means, then there is an abundance of material on almost all subjects on the Internet (YouTube) at this age, and one can also learn from there. One practical piece of advice for those who learn from YouTube is to complete at least two different video series (sequential videos on a single course covering all topics from beginning to end) whenever they learn from YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe next important question is which skills to learn? In my opinion, the appropriate situation is that every student should learn the same skill which is in accordance with his education or degree. In addition, I generally recommend students learn WordPress or graphic design.\r\n\r\nThe 21st century is a digital age, in which their demand and use are relatively higher than other things secondly these two courses do not even require prior computer knowledge. Therefore, it is easy for students to learn them. Other skills like content writing or logo designing can also be learned.\r\n\r\nOnce students have completed a course and are convinced that they have learned, start freelancing from any freelancing platform, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to freelancing, projects can also be done with your relatives or acquaintances.\r\n\r\nThe best way to start this project is to start with two or three friends working on a project together. Because no matter how strong one’s inner belief may be, man learns and attains mastery only through practical work.\r\nThese tips can be applied not only to young people who are studying in universities but also to those who are unemployed or have a menial jobs. Such individuals may set aside some time for this on a daily basis after their working hours, but students may also set aside some time for this learning process in addition to the winter and summer vacations.\r\nThe practical benefit for the students will be that they will continue to learn the skills along with the education and thus after completing the education they will also have practical experience with the certificate. This experience will not only help them in getting a job but if they want to continue their own work they can easily and in a short time increase it further but also provide employment to other people.','442419072_1490065888559057_4963262786765945442_n.jpg','Postpics/2138700352_442419072_1490065888559057_4963262786765945442_n.jpg','Active',1,'2024-05-26 23:35:41','2024-05-27 00:06:45'),

With great power comes great responsibility. Therefore, we must consider both the benefits and potential threats of AI.','While the refinement of Deepfake technology in past years has generated both enthusiasms and worry worldwide, especially in Pakistan’s political arena. Deepfakes enable the deceased to virtually come back to life for future generations, but also raise concerns about the potential abuse of identities.\r\n\r\nUsing still photos of a person, Deepfakes can create moving images that replicate the individual’s expressions and emotions, resulting in a virtually identical replica of a human. While this technology offers endless possibilities, it is important to consider the potential consequences of its use.\r\n\r\nSome experts believe that AI will eventually be able to surpass human intelligence and capabilities in a wide range of areas, while others are more skeptical and believe that human ingenuity and adaptability will continue to outpace technological advancement.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, AI has already made significant strides in a number of fields, and it is likely to continue to do so in the coming years. Some experts even predict that AI could potentially reach a level of intelligence and capability that would allow it to take over certain roles and responsibilities from humans by 2023.\r\n\r\nThere are several factors that could contribute to the rise of AI in the next few years. One of the most significant is the rapid pace of technological advancement. In recent years, we have seen tremendous progress in the development of AI algorithms and systems, and it is likely that this trend will continue. As AI technologies become more sophisticated and powerful, they will be able to take on more complex tasks and responsibilities, potentially surpassing human performance in a wide range of areas.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, one of the main fears about AI is its potential effect on employment. AI could potentially automate a variety of tasks that are currently done by humans, which could result in significant job losses in industries that rely on these workers.\r\n\r\nSome sectors, such as manufacturing and transportation, may be more vulnerable to automation, while others, such as healthcare and education, maybe less so. It is important for individuals and organizations to consider the potential impacts of AI on their specific industries and to adapt and prepare for any potential disruptions.\r\nIt is difficult to predict the future with certainty, but it seems that countries with a history of violating human rights and suppressing dissent may be more susceptible to the misuse of AI. One way in which AI could be used to restrict freedoms is through surveillance. AI-powered surveillance systems can monitor people’s movements and actions, potentially infringing upon privacy and freedom of movement. AI could also be used to censor certain types of content or suppress certain viewpoints. In the not-too-distant future, AI may even be used to make binding decisions about individuals’ lives, such as determining their eligibility for loans or employment, based on data inputs that may not accurately reflect their abilities or circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to discrimination and limit people’s opportunities and freedoms. It is important to be aware of AI’s potential negative impacts on society and work towards mitigating them. As AI continues to advance and become more prevalent in our lives, it is crucial to stay informed about these new tools and consider the potential impact they may have on our society.\r\n\r\nSo, the bottom line is as the world continues to embrace the power of artificial intelligence, we must stay informed about the new tools and consider the potential impact they may have on our society.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most significant technological advancements of our time, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. However, with the increasing use of AI comes a growing concern about data privacy.','Breakthroughs\r\n\r\nOne major breakthrough in AI is the development of AI models like OpenAI and ChatGPT. These models have the ability to understand and generate human language, making them incredibly powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, as with any technology, there are potential risks associated with the use of these models. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for these models to be used to manipulate and deceive people. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-3 model has been used to generate fake news, which can have serious consequences for society.\r\n\r\nNavigating concerns\r\n\r\nAnother primary concern is the potential for these models to be used to invade people’s privacy. AI models are trained on large amounts of data, and this data can be used to build detailed profiles of individuals. This information can then be used for targeted advertising, which can be very effective and invasive. Additionally, the data used to train these models can also be used to identify and track individuals, which can be a violation of their privacy.\r\n\r\nIt is important to be aware that everything we post or comment on the internet is being saved in data and can be accessed by others. Companies and organizations have access to vast amounts of data on individuals, and they are using this data to build detailed profiles of people. This data can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as targeted advertising and political campaigns. It is important for individuals to be aware of the data that is being collected about them and to take steps to protect their privacy.\r\n\r\nLessons from scandals\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the misuse of Facebook data, is a prime example of the risks associated with data privacy. The company harvested data on millions of Facebook users without their consent and used this data to influence political campaigns. This incident brought data privacy to the forefront of public consciousness, highlighting the need for individuals and organizations to be more vigilant about how their data is used.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Brexit scandal has shown how data can be used to influence political campaigns. In the lead-up to the Brexit vote, Leave.EU, the official campaign group for the Leave side, used data from Facebook to target potential voters. The group was able to identify and target individuals who were likely to support the Leave campaign, which helped to sway the vote in their favor. This incident highlights the potential for data to be used to influence political campaigns, and the need for individuals and organizations to be more vigilant about how their data is used.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, privacy is an essential aspect to consider in the AI world. The development of AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, but it also comes with potential risks associated with the use of these models.

(16,3,'Scaffolding Technique to promote students resilience','When we think about success, the things which come in our mind are skills, training, degree, courses, diplomas and programs but there is little success that comes from these. Now in current era, the trades and characteristics which are set for successful people are soft skills like emotional intelligence, Creativity, Critical thinking and resilience.','Resilience cannot outweigh other skills but people who show resilience have emotional strength, a strong connection, strong communication skills, and they can show strong teamwork. Therefore, teachers should promote the resilience in students. Lack of resilience may result in students becoming aloof, aggressive, lose their self-esteem, personal competencies and loss their potential\r\n\r\nNon resilient student can easily be distracted and they’re likely to isolate themselves. They face many psychological and social developmental problems in their later life. During school life they face some mental and emotional traumas.\r\n\r\nStudents have a lots of stress in their life so teachers should help them release their stress with different kind of co-curricular activities. The teacher should set an example for the students through positive attitude because they are going to imitate what they see as they are still in the adaptive stages of their lives, teachers can urge them to speak up for the what is right and not let the negative thoughts prevail their minds.\r\nThroughout my career I have observed that a lot of students get affected by their slow academic progress, and it is our duty to encourage them to work at their own pace.\r\nLet’s not ignore the fact that students also face domestic issues at home, so it is important for the mentor (teacher) to be there for them and provide them with warmth.\r\n\r\nI think people should understand their mental health and take these topics seriously. I have observed that when children start to grow older they tend to cover things from their parents and that leads to parent’s unawareness about the child’s mental health and it easily reflects in their academic progress as well. Therefore, parents should try to bring up the child in a healthy and friendly environment. As for teachers they should not create a mockery out of certain child’s behavior when they can easily see that something is not right. It’s teacher’s duty to understand the child and give them the flexibility that they need to overcome hurdles in difficult aspects of life and potentially get them the help they require.\r\n\r\nAlong with mental health, physical health is also something to be taken seriously. If our child’s body is not ready to perform in the class, how could they be flexible? There are a lot of diseases that lead to the inability to perform in class.\r\n\r\nWhile bad behavior is in discussion, it certainly doesn’t mean that we always temper the child, there are times when the child leads some tough words to mature their thinking and increase their resilience.\r\n\r\nLast but not the least, I need to discuss a topic that I have observed very often ‘Goal setting”. A lot of the students are coming to school just for the sake of coming to school. If they have a clear goal in mind, they would implement more efforts in their study. Along with parents, teachers most definitely can help a child to discover their passions and their interests. If our strong goal is clear, then there is nothing that can stop student from striving for success..','00-c50.jpg','Postpics/2101254131_00-c50.jpg','Active',1,'2024-05-27 10:20:15','2024-05-27 10:26:00'),
(17,3,'What Is The Link Between The Supply of Money &amp; Inflation?','AS ECONOMISTS RING ALARM BELLS REGARDING THE RATE OF INFLATION, ACROSS THE GLOBAL ECONOMIES, I did think it appropriate and relevant to answer a more fundamental question: “What is the link between the supply of money and inflation?” In this brief essay I intend to answer this question with an objective view, so that we can get to the truth of the matter and ascertain the reality of money and inflation, without getting distracted by philosophical propositions and abstract concepts.','When there is an increased supply of money in the economy, people tend to spend that money more, which results in greater demand for goods and services. If the supply of goods and services remain constant, but the money supply increases and so does the demand for goods and services, the average price of those goods and services increases in response. This is the most basic explanation of inflation.\r\n\r\nThe link between money and inflation is that the former can cause the latter if there is no real change in economic output. In other words, if the money in circulation increases but the production of goods and services does not increase proportionally but remains constant, then sellers must increase prices. As Milton Friedman explained it with such simplicity, “Inflation is caused by too much money chasing after too few goods.” In the case of inflation, more money equals more problems!\r\n\r\nEconomists say that with the increase of the supply of money there appears an increase in aggregate demand which results in higher prices.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples from history of increased money supply causing inflation:\r\n\r\n    US Confederacy 1862-65 In the USA, there was a civil war between the north and the south about several issues, including slavery. The southern states required slaves for economic reasons, since they were a primarily agricultural-oriented society, with cotton being a major crop for production. The southern states set up their own country known as Confederate States of America (CSA), which was not recognized by Great Britain but was granted a neutral status which later the British withdrew for their own reasons of not encouraging the working-class rebelling in the United Kingdom. During this internal war between the southern states and the northern states, the former found itself short of finance (the CSA only managed to raise approximately half of the cost of war around 46% from taxes and bonds) so they printed more money to pay for materials and soldiers in war. The problem was that the economic reality did not reflect the surge in the printing of money; real economic output was falling, but the money printed was surging, resulting in inflation of 700% in the first two years of the war and reached a peak of more than 5000% by the end of the war.\r\n     German Hyperinflation 1923 When Germany was forced to pay reparations after WW1, it was having economic problems. As a result, the government engaged in printing money, in fact too much money. When Germany reached the important year of 1923, the economy had reached the critical phase of hyperinflation.\r\n     Zimbabwe 2008 Recently, the African nation of Zimbabwe experienced hyperinflation. When the government debt reached high levels, economic output declined, the nation adopted the German strategy of printing more money to reduce the crisis. This printing of money led to hyperinflation of an estimated 79,600,000,000% in Nov 2008. A daily inflation rate of 98%\r\n     US economy 2020/21 When Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the US economy declined enormously. This meant the Federal Reserve had to create more money. In 1-2years inflation struck hard (this inflation was also caused by other factors such as commodity price rises and supply chain disruptions).\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that increasing the money supply does not always cause inflation.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to increase the money supply without causing inflation. There are a few possible reasons:\r\n\r\n     The growth of real output is the same as the growth of the money supply. If we imagine that the supply of money increased by 10 %. This would lead to an increase of Aggregate Demand by the same percentage in a simplified model. And if the productive capacity of the economy also increased by 10% then the price level would be unaffected. In other words, the growth of the money supply is absorbed in the increase in real output.\r\n     Increase in bank reserve ratios. The Federal Reserve increased the monetary base by over 120%; however, this did not result in inflation, in fact, the US experienced temporary deflation. The main reason is that banks increased their reserve ratio. Essentially banks received extra money from the Federal Reserve but did not want to lend it to ordinary firms and households. Therefore, the extra money supply did not reach the wider economy and there was no inflationary impact.\r\n     Hard to Measure Money Supply. Sometimes the money supply is hard to calculate and is constantly changing. Large increases in the money supply are often just due to changes in the way people hold money. For example, an increase in credit card use may cause an increase in the broad money supply M4.\r\n     Changes in velocity of Circulation. The quantity theory of money equation MV=PY assumes that an increase in M causes an increase in P. However, this assumes that V (velocity of circulation) is constant, and Y is constant. However, in practice, it is not as simple as this equation assumes. There are often variations in the velocity of circulation. A good example is in a recession, the stock of money may rise 5%, however, people will be making fewer transactions and therefore the velocity of circulation will fall. This is one reason why quantitative easing (increasing the money supply) did not cause inflation between 2009 and 2016.\r\n     Keynesian view – Liquidity Trap In a recession, there is spare capacity in the economy. Therefore, an increase in the money supply merely helps to get unemployed resources used in the general economy. Therefore, in the case of a recession, an increased money supply is unlikely to cause inflation. In a liquidity trap, interest rates fall to zero, but this doesn’t prevent people from saving. In this situation, there is a fall in the velocity of circulation, and this can cause deflation. In this situation, increasing the money supply will not necessarily cause inflation.','glenn-carstens-peters-npxXWgQ33ZQ-unsplash.jpg','Postpics/1915205171_glenn-carstens-peters-npxXWgQ33ZQ-unsplash.jpg','Active',0,'2024-05-27 10:47:07',NULL);
